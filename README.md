# Breathing Tool — Guided Breathwork Timer

A simple, elegant React-based breathing exercise tool that guides you through a 4-step breathing cycle: **Inhale**, **Hold**, **Exhale**, and **Rest**.

## Features

- Smooth transitions with color changes and glowing animations for each breathing phase  
- Adjustable visual scaling to match breathing phases (expand/contract circle)  
- Displays only whole seconds counting down for clarity  
- Wide, clean, and responsive background area for comfortable viewing  
- Start, Pause, and Reset controls for full user control  
- Minimal dependencies — easy to integrate or customize  

## Landing Page

The landing page provides a clean, focused interface where users can:

- See a calm, wide background that changes color with each breathing phase  
- View a large circular visual that expands and contracts to guide breathing rhythm  
- Follow a clear countdown timer showing whole seconds for each phase  
- Access Start, Pause, and Reset buttons for controlling the session  

The design emphasizes minimalism and ease of use to help users relax and focus on their breathing without distractions.

## How it works

The timer cycles automatically through:

1. Inhale (4 seconds)  
2. Hold (7 seconds)  
3. Exhale (8 seconds)  
4. Rest (4 seconds)  

Each phase changes the background color, circle size, and glow effect to visually guide your breath rhythm.
